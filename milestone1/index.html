            <h2> Website Summary </h2>
            <h4> What content will the site contain?</h4>
                <p> The website will contain content pertaining the work that this company does.
                    It will provide content on the things they wash like singular semi-trucks, fleet washing, and heavy machinery.
                    The boss who owns this company also has a window washing company, so maybe I'll merge that with this too.
                </p>           
            <h4> Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
                <p>
                    I work for this company, so we usually take before and after pictures of the stuff we wash.
                    So I will personally take the photos and upload them to the website.
                </p>            
            <h4> Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
                <p>
                    There are people who are looking for services like this in Southern Utah. This makes it a relevent topic to search for in the community.
                    With that, if the purpose of my wesbite is hopefully clearly displayed through the text and images I put in. The person will start to begin to
                    trust or find us very credible.
                </p>            
            <h4> Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
                <p>
                    When a website like this is made, it will show up on search engines. This will help the company get more recognition in the area and earn potential
                    clients. It can be used to show off the final product, this will start creating trust in potential clients and earn the company more credibility. 
                    Not a whole lot of these types of companies have websites, atleast in the Southern Utah area.
                </p>
            <h4> What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
