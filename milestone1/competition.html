            <h2> What is it being done by the competition?</h2>
                <p>
                   Very few of the competitors have websites made for people to find on google.
                   Some of these websites are fairly basic. They just have the main page that shows everything they do.
                   Then they have links to be able to contact them, or recieve a quote. A well made website I had found has
                   tabs close to the top where you can find information about doing residential stuff and commercial stuff.
                   Obviously I can not do what's been done on the well done website, but I would to attempt to do it and make those tabs look good as well.
                   I think I can show our products we wash in better and cleaner way. Showing before and after photos and if possible show timelapse footage of them washing
